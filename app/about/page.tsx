                    Drake helped co-found Ponderosa Talent Group after five years
                    with two of the largest IT staffing agencies where he was a
                    consistent top-performer both as a Recruiter & Account
                    Executive. He prides himself on a personalized approach,
                    taking the time to understand both the aspirations of his
                    candidates and the specific needs of his clients to create
                    successful matches that make sense for each.

                  <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    Drake&apos;s primary focuses are Data & Analytics, Cloud
                    Engineering, and IT Security. Drake wanted to build
                    Ponderosa Talent Group as he believes there is a market for
                    organizations that can provide high-quality delivery without
                    sacrificing an honest and collaborative style where everyone
                    wins.

                    Originally from Colorado, Drake is a graduate of University
                    of Colorado with a degree in Economics. Drake is a massive
                    sports fan with his favorite teams being the Chicago Cubs,
                    Denver Broncos, Colorado Avalanche, and Colorado Buffaloes.
                    When he&apos;s not following sports, he can be found trying
                    to stay calm on the golf course and spending as much time
                    with family and friends as he can.
